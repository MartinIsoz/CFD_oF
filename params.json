Our main tools are OpenFOAM, Paraview and Python.\r\n\r\n## Research motivation and background\r\n\r\n### Research motivation\r\nMultiphase flow is of great importance in many chemical engineering applications. As examples, we may mention a description of hydrodynamics in absorption and distillation columns or bubble column reactors.\r\n\r\nIn our research, we focus mainly on the first of the listed processes. More specifically, we are aiming at modeling the flows with the utmost importance of the interfacial area size. Hence, the direct application of our work can be found in designing the above mentioned separation columns.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nA few notes on a structured packing and on a liquid flow on it.\r\n\r\n#### Liquid flow on a structured packing\r\n\r\n* Column diameter: 15 cm\r\n* Packing: Mellapak 252Y.\r\n* System: Water-steel-air\r\n* No gas flow\r\n* Moderate liquid flow rate\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CB99zNa4kLU\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/CB99zNa4kLU/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Water flow on a structured packing\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n\r\n#### Structured packing\r\n\r\n* Complex structure\r\n* Composed from curled, textred, perforated plates\r\n* Various materials (yet steel is the most used one)\r\n\r\n![Overall view of steel packing][packingOV]\r\n![Top view of steel packing][packingTV]\r\n![Front view of a dismantled packing][dispackFV]\r\n![Top view of a dismantled packing][dispackTV]\r\n\r\n[packingOV]: https://github.com/MartinIsoz/MuPhFInCE/tree/master/AA_images/vyplnOVCroppedSMALL.png \"Overall view of Mellapak 252Y packing\"\r\n[packingTV]: https://github.com/MartinIsoz/MuPhFInCE/tree/master/AA_images/vyplnTVCroppedSMALL.png \"Top view of Mellapak 252Y packing\"\r\n[disPackFV]: https://github.com/MartinIsoz/MuPhFInCE/tree/master/AA_images/vypln3CroppedSMALL.png \"Front view of a dismantled packing\"\r\n[disPackTV]: https://github.com/MartinIsoz/MuPhFInCE/tree/master/AA_images/vypln4CroppedSMALL.png \"Top view of a dismantled packing\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Droplet spreading\r\n\r\n## Liquid flow down an inclined plate\r\n\r\n### Smooth plate\r\n\r\n### Textured plate\r\n\r\n#### Longitudinal texture\r\n\r\n#### Transversal texture\r\n\r\n#### Pyramidal texture\r\n\r\n### Wetted to total area ratios in dependence on the flow Weber number\r\n\r\n## Liquid flow between two perforated plates\r\n",
