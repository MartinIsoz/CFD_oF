Our main tools are OpenFOAM, Paraview and Python.\r\n\r\n## Research motivation and background\r\n\r\n### Research motivation\r\nMultiphase flow is of great importance in many chemical engineering applications. As examples, we may mention a description of hydrodynamics in absorption and distillation columns or bubble column reactors.\r\n\r\nIn our research, we focus mainly on the first of the listed processes. More specifically, we are aiming at modeling the flows with the utmost importance of the interfacial area size. Hence, the direct application of our work can be found in designing the above mentioned separation columns.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nA few notes on a structured packing and on a liquid flow on it.\r\n\r\n#### Liquid flow on a structured packing\r\n\r\n* Column diameter: 15 cm\r\n* Packing: Mellapak 252Y.\r\n* System: Water-steel-air\r\n* No gas flow\r\n* Moderate liquid flow rate\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CB99zNa4kLU\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/CB99zNa4kLU/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Water flow on a structured packing\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n\r\n#### Structured packing\r\n\r\n* Complex structure\r\n* Composed from curled, textred, perforated plates\r\n* Various materials (yet steel is the most used one)\r\n\r\n* ![Overall view of steel packing][packingOV]\r\n* ![Top view of steel packing][packingTV]\r\n* ![Front view of a dismantled packing][dispackFV]\r\n* ![Top view of a dismantled packing][dispackTV]\r\n\r\n[packingOV]: <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinIsoz/MuPhFInCE/master/AA_images/vyplnOVCroppedSMALL.png\" alt=\"Overall view of Mellapak 252Y packing\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" border=\"10\" />\r\n[packingTV]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinIsoz/MuPhFInCE/master/AA_images/vyplnTVCroppedSMALL.png \"Top view of Mellapak 252Y packing\"\r\n[disPackFV]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinIsoz/MuPhFInCE/master/AA_images/vypln3CroppedSMALL.png \"Front view of a dismantled packing\"\r\n[disPackTV]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinIsoz/MuPhFInCE/master/AA_images/vypln4CroppedSMALL.png \"Top view of a dismantled packing\"\r\n\r\n#### Our approach to the problem\r\n\r\nSeparation columns, apparatuses used in chemical engineering to perform the mass transfer operations in large scales, host a complex set of physical processes including heat and mass transfer and multiphase flow. Even with the continuous development of computational fluid mechanics (CFD) methodology and the lasting growth of available computing power, the direct modeling of processes in packed columns is still an open issue. To develop a direct numerical simulation of a packed column, one would have to simultaneously solve the balance equations for momentum, mass, energy and the present species, all of which completed by a reliable model of mass and heat transfer across the interface. From a mathematics point of view, such a model would have to consist of (at least) six partial differential equations and several algebraic equations defined on a complex domain forced by the packing geometry.\r\n\r\nBecause of the aforementioned complexity, it is a common practice to study the processes occurring in packed columns on simplified surrogate models. One of the currently most common approaches is to reduce the geometrical complexity of the column packing and to approximate a small part of it by an inclined plate. Thus, the properties of interest (hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer) are studied in a simple cuboid geometry.\r\n\r\n#### Cooperations\r\nAs the nature of our work would suggest, we closely cooperate with the [Mass transfer group of UCT Prague](http://www.mass-transfer.cz) as well as with the [CFD Laboratory of UCT Prague (cs)](http://fchi.vscht.cz/veda-a-vyzkum/vyzkumna-pracoviste/cfd).\r\n\r\n## Droplet spreading\r\n\r\n## Liquid flow down an inclined plate\r\n\r\n### Smooth plate\r\n\r\n### Textured plate\r\n\r\n#### Longitudinal texture\r\n\r\n#### Transversal texture\r\n\r\n#### Pyramidal texture\r\n\r\n### Wetted to total area ratios in dependence on the flow Weber number\r\n\r\n## Liquid flow between two perforated plates\r\n",
